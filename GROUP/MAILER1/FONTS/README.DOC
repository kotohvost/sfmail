Hello d00ds,

Norton Utilities and their cool text fonts! All becomes possible 
with my little font management library for EGA/VGA text modes.
No charge is required for the author, and no guarantees are
provided. See program SAVEFONT.PAS for getting how it all works.
SAVEFONT will save current (active) EGA/VGA text font into file.

I hope these sources will make you even more happy.

Thank you for reading this document,
